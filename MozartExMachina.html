                        <p>The goal of this project is to get some firsthand experience with machine learning.</p>

                        <p>We start with a basic task: create an artificial neural network that can predict a song based on a sequence of notes.</p>

                        <p>To keep the problem simple, we'll look exclusively at music by Mozart.</p>

                            The music itself is in the public domain, and the files are made available by a Creative Commons license.

                            The dataset contains 21 movements, three each for seven pieces.
                            These pieces are numbered 311, 330, 331, 332, 333, 545, and 570.
                            Their files names are <code>mz_311_1.mid</code>, indicating composer, piece, and movement.

                            ## Manipulating the data

                            To manipulate the data, I'm using [music21](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/).
                            This is an open-source Python toolkit for handling MIDI files, which is the format of the data.

                            ```python
                            import music21
                            midi_data=music21.converter.parse('mz_311_1.mid')
                            ```
                        </textarea>
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        <textarea data-template>
                            Let's check the data.

                            ```python
                            midi_data.measure(144).show('text')
                            ```

                            We see information on the 144th measure of this song:
                            what instruments were played,
                            the clef, key, tempo and meter,
                            and a list of notes.
                        </textarea>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Data in `music21` is stored as streams.
                            Data extracted from the MIDI files is stored as scores.
                            Each score is divided in to parts, usually Piano Left and Piano Right.
                            These parts are then divided into measures.
                            Each measure contains its notes and rests.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        <textarea data-template>
                            So to extract all notes from the data, we need to recurse through all of these layers.

                            ```python
                            data=midi_data.recurse().notes
                            ```

                            This gives us a master list of notes for the entire song.

                        <h4>Feature Space</h4>

                        <p>
                            To feed data to an ANN, we need to identify features we want the network to learn.
                            Based on the goal of the project, we want these features to relate to a selection of music.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Based on the way music is stored in MIDI files and manipulated by `music21`,
                            we can represent a selection of music as a set of notes, their duration, and their offset from a reference point.
                            For each note in our datum, we have 3 features.
                            So if each datum is a sequence of 10 notes, then that datum has 30 features.

                            We can represent notes by their pitch.
                            Chords, however, are made up of many notes and can't be easily reduced to an ordinal format.
                            We sidestep this by dividing chords into their consituent notes.

                            To use the classifier, first split up the data into training and test sets,
                            initialize the classifier,
                            and feed it the training set.

                            ```python
                            from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
                            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=0)

                            from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
                            clf = RandomForestClassifier(
                                n_estimators=100, 
                                max_features='sqrt', 
                                max_depth=None, 
                                min_samples_split=2
                            )
                            clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
                            ```
                        </textarea>

                            For that task, we use the test dataset we split off earlier.

                            ```python
                            from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
                            print(accuracy_score(clf.predict(X_test),y_test))
                            ```
                            
                            We need the accuracy score to be greater than 1/21, or the classifier is only as good as a random guess.

                            <li>I originally tried to keep chords whole, but I had no obvious way of encoding the feature space.</li>
                            <li>I didn't put any importance on max_features when initializing the classifier.
                                I thought I only needed to include more notes in the sequences, but without a corresponding increase in max_features, the classifier wouldn't notice the difference.
